<p>I have done a huge redesign of my Homelab.
To better test VCF scenarios, 3 new #Minisforum MS-01 have been added.
These have a 13th generation i9 and are equipped with fast NVMes for memory tiering.
They also have 2x10G and 2x2.5G networking on board for various VM workloads.
Furthermore, I converted my storage from NFS to iSCSI with multipathing, which gets even more performance out of my self-built #Unraid.
I manage about 2 GB/s read / 1.2 GB GB/s write and 78K IOPS (Random 4K with 32Q) in a Windows 11 VM.</p>

<p>Pretty impressive for my setup. I still have to customize the rack a bit so that I can add the 10G Mikrotik switch and clean up the VLANs from old labs.
I&rsquo;m already planning a further expansion stage though.</p>
