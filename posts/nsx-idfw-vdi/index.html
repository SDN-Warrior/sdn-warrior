In addition, each user/user group receives individual firewall rules, which corresponds to the need-to-know principle.\nYou can use the Identity Firewall in 2 ways: Variant 1 would be with VMware Tools and Guest Introspection.

I use variant 1 because the implementation means less effort in my customer setup and we only want to protect the VDIs with Idendity Firewall.\nLimitations No User /Group ID Support for Federation. No direct integration with VDI and RDSH. User-ID based rules are supported for only firewall rules. No User-ID based policy for IDS/IPS and TLS Inspection. Multi-User (RDSH) does not support Server Message Block (SMP) protocol. ",

<p>A customer of mine has the use case that his entire environment must be micro-segmented. Of course, this does not stop at the VDI environment. Since my customer uses non-persistent VDIs (the VMs are deleted after each logoff), no tags can be used for the security groups. After deleting the VM, the tag would also be removed and a new VDI would have no tags and would thus be isolated. This can be solved with automation or with the Identity Firewall (a combination of both solutions is also conceivable and makes sense). In the first step, my customer opted for the Identity Firewall because it allows generic VDIs to be used and authorisations to resources can be conveniently controlled via the customer AD. In addition, each user/user group receives individual firewall rules, which corresponds to the need-to-know principle.</p>
